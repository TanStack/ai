Streaming structured output across the OpenAI-compatible providers, an OpenAI Chat Completions sibling adapter, a summarize-subsystem unification, and the decoupling of `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the shared OpenAI base.

## Core — `@tanstack/ai`

- New `chat({ outputSchema, stream: true })` overload returning `StructuredOutputStream<InferSchemaType<TSchema>>`. The stream yields raw JSON deltas via `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` plus a terminal `CUSTOM` `structured-output.complete` event whose `value.object` is typed against the caller's schema with no helper or cast required.
- `StructuredOutputStream<T>` is a discriminated union over three tagged `CUSTOM` variants — `structured-output.complete<T>`, `approval-requested`, and `tool-input-available` (new `ApprovalRequestedEvent` / `ToolInputAvailableEvent` interfaces exported from `@tanstack/ai`). Narrowing on `chunk.type === 'CUSTOM' && chunk.name === '<literal>'` resolves `chunk.value` to the exact shape per variant. The bare `CustomEvent` (with `value: any`) is deliberately excluded to keep the narrow from collapsing to `any`; user-emitted events via the `emitCustomEvent` context API still flow at runtime and are documented as a small residual gap.
- Activity-layer hardening: always-finalise after the stream loop (no silent hangs on missing `finishReason`), typed `RUN_ERROR` on empty content, mid-stream provider errors terminate cleanly, schema-validation failures carry `runId / model / timestamp`.
- `fallbackStructuredOutputStream` in the activity layer is the single source of truth for adapters that don't implement `structuredOutputStream` natively; `BaseTextAdapter` no longer ships a default.
- `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter.summarizeStream` accumulates summary text and emits a terminal `CUSTOM` `generation:result` event before the final `RUN_FINISHED`. Fixes `useSummarize` never populating `result` over streaming connections (the client only sets `result` on that specific CUSTOM event).
- `SummarizationOptions` is now generic in `TProviderOptions` and `modelOptions` is plumbed through end-to-end (previously silently dropped by `runSummarize` / `runStreamingSummarize`).

## Base — `@tanstack/openai-base`

- Package renamed from `@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible` (which remains published for pinned lockfiles but receives no further updates). Imports change:

  ```diff
  - import { OpenAICompatibleChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
  + import { OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
  - import { OpenAICompatibleResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
  + import { OpenAIBaseResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
  ```

- Centralised `structuredOutputStream` on both bases. Chat Completions uses `response_format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`; Responses uses `text.format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`. Subclasses (`ai-openai`, `ai-grok`, `ai-groq`) inherit it; OpenRouter implements its own (see below).
- Base now adopts the `openai` SDK directly and imports types from `openai/resources/...`. The previously-vendored ~720 LOC of wire-format types (`ChatCompletion`, `ResponseStreamEvent`, etc.) is removed; consumers that imported wire types from the package should import them from the openai SDK instead. The abstract `callChatCompletion*` / `callResponse*` hooks are gone — the base constructor now takes a pre-built `OpenAI` client (`new OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter(model, name, openaiClient)`) and calls `client.chat.completions.create` / `client.responses.create` itself.
- New protected `isAbortError(error)` hook duck-types abort detection so `RUN_ERROR { code: 'aborted' }` is emitted consistently across SDK error types — subclasses with proprietary error classes (e.g. `@openrouter/sdk`'s `RequestAbortedError`) override.
- Per-chunk `logger.provider(...)` debug logging now fires inside `structuredOutputStream` loops, matching the existing pattern in `chatStream` for end-to-end introspection in debug mode.

The other extension hooks (`extractReasoning`, `extractTextFromResponse`, `processStreamChunks`, `makeStructuredOutputCompatible`, `transformStructuredOutput`, `mapOptionsToRequest`, `convertMessage`) remain. Groq's `processStreamChunks` and `makeStructuredOutputCompatible` overrides (for `x_groq.usage` promotion and Groq's structured-output schema quirks) are unchanged.

## Provider adapters

| Adapter | API | Reasoning surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiText` | Responses | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` (requires `reasoning.summary: 'auto'`) |
| `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiChatCompletions` (new) | Chat Completions | reasoning emitted silently — Chat Completions has no `reasoning.summary` opt-in |
| `@tanstack/ai-grok` `grokText` | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning_content` (DeepSeek convention; not typed by OpenAI SDK) |
| `@tanstack/ai-groq` `groqText` | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning` (requires `reasoning_format: 'parsed'`; not typed by groq-sdk) |
| `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterText` | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoningDetails` (camelCase) |
| `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterResponsesText` (beta) | Responses (beta) | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` via `normalizeStreamEvent` |

All six emit the contractual `REASONING_*` lifecycle (`REASONING_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas → `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` → `REASONING_END`) and close it before `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`. Accumulated reasoning is also surfaced on `structured-output.complete.value.reasoning` for consumers that only subscribe to the terminal event. OpenRouter SDK's proprietary `RequestAbortedError` is mapped (alongside DOM `AbortError`) to `code: 'aborted'` in the two openrouter adapters.

`@tanstack/ai-openai` also exports a new `OpenAIChatCompletionsTextAdapter` / `openaiChatCompletions` / `createOpenaiChatCompletions` factory — a sibling to the existing Responses adapter for callers who want the older `/v1/chat/completions` wire format against the OpenAI SDK.

## Decouple `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the OpenAI base

OpenRouter ships its own SDK (`@openrouter/sdk`) with a camelCase shape, so inheriting from the OpenAI-shaped base forced a snake_case ↔ camelCase round-trip on every request and stream event. ai-openrouter now extends `BaseTextAdapter` directly and inlines its own stream processors (`OpenRouterTextAdapter` for chat-completions, `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` for the Responses beta), reading OpenRouter's camelCase types natively. The `@tanstack/openai-base` and `openai` dependencies are removed from ai-openrouter; only `@openrouter/sdk`, `@tanstack/ai`, and `@tanstack/ai-utils` remain. The ~300 LOC of inbound/outbound shape converters (`toOpenRouterRequest`, `toChatCompletion`, `adaptOpenRouterStreamChunks`, `toSnakeResponseResult`, …) are gone. Internal: duck-typed `as { ... }` casts on stream chunks in `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` are replaced with direct narrowing via the SDK's discriminated unions.

Public OpenRouter API is unchanged: `openRouterText`, `openRouterResponsesText`, `createOpenRouterText`, `createOpenRouterResponsesText`, the OpenRouter tool factories, provider routing surface (`provider`, `models`, `plugins`, `variant`, `transforms`), app attribution headers (`httpReferer`, `appTitle`), `:variant` model suffixing, `RequestAbortedError` propagation, and the OpenRouter-specific structured-output null-preservation all behave the same.

`ai-ollama` remains on `BaseTextAdapter` directly — its native API uses a different wire format from Chat Completions and was never on the shared base.

## Summarize subsystem

Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter previously each shipped a bespoke 200–300 LOC summarize adapter. They now construct a `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` (formerly `ChatStreamWrapperAdapter`, renamed and exported from `@tanstack/ai/activities`) wrapping their own text adapter, matching the existing OpenAI/Grok pattern. Removes ~600 LOC of duplicated logic across the six providers and ensures behavioural parity.

Bespoke `*SummarizeProviderOptions` interfaces (e.g. `OpenAISummarizeProviderOptions`, `AnthropicSummarizeProviderOptions`, `GeminiSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OllamaSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OpenRouterSummarizeProviderOptions`) are removed from the provider packages' public exports. Consumers who imported them should switch to inferring the type from the adapter (`InferTextProviderOptions<typeof adapter>`) or remove the explicit annotation (it'll be inferred from the adapter argument).

`SummarizeAdapter` interface methods are now generic in `TProviderOptions`. `summarize` and `summarizeStream` previously took `SummarizationOptions` (defaulted, so `modelOptions` was effectively `Record<string, any>` regardless of the adapter's typed shape). They now take `SummarizationOptions<TProviderOptions>`. Source-compatible for callers that didn't specify the generic; type-tighter for implementers and downstream consumers. `SummarizationOptions`, `SummarizeAdapter`, `BaseSummarizeAdapter`, and `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` previously had a mixed `Record<string, any>` / `Record<string, unknown>` / `object` set of defaults for `TProviderOptions`; they now uniformly default to `Record<string, unknown>`.
