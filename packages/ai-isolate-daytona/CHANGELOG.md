## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1840](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1840) [`f1b3f65`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/f1b3f65a59fb75116bd52abbb162cab8c763d10e) - TanStack AI 1.0.0. This release removes every API that was deprecated in 0.x. Read the upgrade guide before you upgrade: https://tanstack.com/ai/latest/docs/migration/v1
  - Removed all `@deprecated` exports, options, fields, and type aliases. Each one has a replacement that already shipped in 0.x.
  - Removed `addToolApprovalResponse()` from `ChatClient` and every chat hook. Resolve the bound `tool-approval` interrupt with `resolveInterrupt` instead. The devtools event `tools:approval:responded` is also removed.
  - Removed the old wire formats: the CUSTOM `approval-requested` and `tool-input-available` events, the `[DONE]` SSE line, the `data` copy of `forwardedProps`, pre-binding interrupt descriptors and their `approval_required` and `client_tool_input` reasons, and the STEP events that adapters sent next to `REASONING_*` events. Use a 1.0 client with a 1.0 server.
  - Removed the `toolName` alias from `TOOL_CALL_START` chunks. Read `toolCallName` instead.
  - `threadId` is now required on `useChat` and every other chat hook, `ChatClient`, the generation hooks and clients, `chat()`, `summarize()`, the generation functions, `codeModeWithSnippets()`, `selectRelevantSnippets()`, `CompactionContext`, and `SummarizeInput`. TanStack AI no longer makes a thread id for you. Pass a stable id for each conversation. `createChatHook` factory options no longer take `threadId`: pass it on each hook call. Octane generation hooks take `threadId` instead of `id`. `@tanstack/ai-sandbox` removes `resolveDurableThreadId` and `DurableThreadIdRequiredError`.
  - The published `@tanstack/ai-octane/ui` types are now strict. `UI.Messages`, `UI.Message`, `UI.Part`, and `UI.Interrupts` type their render children. `ToolProps` types `part.input` and `part.output` for the named tool. `toolsComponents` and `interruptsComponents` are required when the chat options declare tools or named interrupts. Code that relied on the old loose types can fail to compile.
  - A connection adapter's `connect()` and `send()` need the run context (with `threadId`) as their fourth argument. `ChatClient` and the generation clients pass it.
  - `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`: `createToolBridgeCore()`, `startHostToolBridge()`, a `ToolBridgeProvisioner`, and `executeHostTool()` take a required `threadId`. Bridged tools get it in their context.
  - `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`: the harness tool bridge and `executeHostTool()` refuse a tool with `needsApproval`. Before, the tool ran with no approval. Remove `needsApproval`, or run the tool with an HTTP adapter.
  - `stream()` and `rpcStream()` pass the AG-UI `RunAgentInput` for the run as the fourth factory argument, the same body the HTTP adapters send. Read it on the server with `chatParamsFromRequestBody()` or `generationParamsFromBody()`, so `threadId`, `runId`, and interrupt `resume` reach a server function. `RunAgentInput` is exported from `@tanstack/ai/client`.
  - A generation `fetcher` gets `threadId` and `runId` in its second argument, next to `signal` and `headers`. Pass them to the server generation call.
  - `generationParamsFromBody()` and `generationParamsFromRequest()` read the generation input from `forwardedProps`. A server that reads `body.data` gets `undefined`. Read `body.forwardedProps` instead. They also require `threadId` and `runId` and return them as strings, the same as `chatParamsFromRequestBody()` and the AG-UI `RunAgentInput`. A body that holds only the input is rejected.
  - Removed the readers for data saved in old 0.x formats (old Cloudflare run-log records, a bare `UIMessage[]` from client persistence, artifact records without `blobKey`).
  - Removed provider models that are shut down.
  - `@tanstack/ai-react-ui`, `@tanstack/ai-solid-ui`, and `@tanstack/ai-vue-ui` get no 1.0 release. Import from `@tanstack/ai-react/ui`, `@tanstack/ai-solid/ui`, or `@tanstack/ai-vue/ui`.

### Patch Changes

- [#1071](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1071) [`ea9c077`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/ea9c07724bd6992480238a699fbb18835eab743e) - fix: publish internal dependency ranges as `^x.y.z` instead of exact pins

  Internal dependencies on other TanStack AI packages used `workspace:*` in
  `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`. pnpm rewrites that to an **exact** version
  at publish time, so a released package asked for e.g. `@tanstack/ai-utils@0.4.0`
  rather than `^0.4.0`.

  Two consequences for consumers:
  - **Duplicate copies.** An exact pin cannot dedupe. Installing a newer
    `@tanstack/ai` alongside a package pinned to the previous patch produced two
    copies in the tree, which breaks `instanceof` checks and module-level state,
    and inflates bundles.
  - **Unsatisfiable peers.** An exactly pinned `peerDependency` conflicts the
    moment the internal package ships its next patch, forcing consumers into
    overrides or `--legacy-peer-deps`.

  These fields now use `workspace:^`, which publishes as `^x.y.z`. Every package
  here is still `0.x`, so `^0.43.1` resolves to `0.43.x` only — patches dedupe
  cleanly and no breaking minor is ever pulled in.

  `devDependencies` deliberately keep `workspace:*`: they are never published, and
  `*` correctly means "always build against the local copy".
